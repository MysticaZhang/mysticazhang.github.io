I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:

$ hugo --theme=gohugo-ananke --baseUrl="http://mysticazhang.github.io/"
$ cd public
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/mysticazhang/mysticazhang.github.io.git
$ git status 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "second commit"
$ git push -u origin master

* 每次更新完将public文件删除
* 新建的public文件夹中的文件拖到github.io里
* 从第三步进行更新
