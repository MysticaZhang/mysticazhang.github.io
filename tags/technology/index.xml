      <description>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
But they answered: &amp;ldquo;Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?&amp;rdquo;
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.</description>
